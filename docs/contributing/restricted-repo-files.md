# Restricted repo files

This project uses automated tooling for releases, formatting, documentation, and configuration.

To keep the repository stable and predictable, certain files must **not** be edited in pull requests unless explicitly requested by a maintainer.

## Do not modify these files

- **CHANGELOG.md** — Automatically generated by the release pipeline. Any manual edits will be overwritten.
- **CODEOWNERS** — Defines review and approval rules. Changes require maintainer approval and are not accepted through general PRs.
- **LICENSE** — Legal document. Only maintainers may update it.

### Release and automation configs

These files are part of the automated release and CI/CD pipeline and must remain stable:

- `.releaserc` or `release.config.*`
- `.github/workflows/*`
- `package.json` (release‑related fields)
- `semantic-release` configuration

### Formatting and linting configs

These define the project’s formatting and linting rules:

- `prettier.config.*`
- `eslint.config.*`
- `.editorconfig`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `vitest.config.*`

### Root‑level configuration files

Unless a maintainer requests a change, do not modify files at the repository root  
(except `README.md` and `mkdocs.yml`).

---

## Allowed areas for contributions

Most contributions should be limited to:

- `mkdocs.yml` — Documentation site navigation.
- `README.md` — General project information (raise the bar!).
- `src/` — Implementation.
- `tests/` — Test suites.
- `docs/` — Documentation.
- `coverage/` — Generated coverage artifacts (rarely edited manually).

---

## Exceptions

If a change to a restricted file is required to fix a bug, improve documentation, or resolve a configuration issue, **open an issue first**.

A maintainer will confirm whether the change is appropriate before a PR is opened.

---

This policy ensures:

- Consistent automation.
- Predictable releases.
- Stable contributor experience.
- Clear separation between code and infrastructure.
