# Reference

The Reference section documents every helper in Jane. Each page includes a clear description, the function signature, parameter tables, return shapes, examples, and notes. All helpers follow the same predictable structure so you can find what you need quickly.

Use this section when you already understand the concepts and workflows and need precise, implementation‑level details about a specific helper.

## What’s included

Jane’s helpers are organized into several categories. Each category has its own index page and detailed entries for every function.

- **Type guards**: Safe checks for types and shapes.
- **Normalizers**: Pure functions that convert unknown input into predictable forms.
- **Validators**: Boolean or result‑based checks for correctness.
- **Pipelines** — Tools like `pipe()` for composing helpers.

Each category is intentionally small and focused.

## Type guards

Helpers that check types and shapes without throwing.

Use these when you need safe branching logic or want to narrow unknown input before normalization or validation.

## How to read this section

Every helper is documented with the same predictable structure:

- A short description.
- The function signature.
- A parameter table.
- The return shape.
- Examples.
- Notes and edge cases.

All entries are self‑contained, deterministic, and free of side effects.

You can read them in any order.
