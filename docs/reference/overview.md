# Reference

The Reference section documents every helper in Jane. Each page includes a clear description, the function signature, parameter tables, return shapes, examples, and notes. All helpers follow the same predictable structure so you can find what you need quickly.

Use this section when you already understand the concepts and workflows, and you need precise details about a specific helper.

## What’s included

Jane includes several categories of helpers. Each category has its own index page and detailed entries for every function.

## Type Guards

Helpers that check types and shapes without throwing.

Use these when you need safe branching logic.
